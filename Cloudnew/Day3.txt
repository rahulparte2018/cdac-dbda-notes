EC2
elastic compute cloud
used for launching virtual servers
- launch an instance
- name and tags - testing my webserver
- we can have different operating system on the cloud
- choose amazon linux
- free tier - one server
- amazon linux 2 kernel 5.10
- duration is 1 year

instance type
- gives us the resources available for us
- t2 micro - 1Gb ram - 0.0116 $ per hour
- here we select the amount of resources required

key pair login
- only able to use once
- so save the key properly or else you will lose access to your EC2 account
- create new key 
- key pair name - testingkey
- key pair type - RSA
- keep everything default

network settings
- all options as default
- allow SSH traffic from

Configure storage
- 8 gs

to go to the EC2, click on the blue hyperlink
or
click on the instances on the left and search for the required instance

alarm status 
- aws also has its own internal alarm set

location of the server depends on where the application user are.

Connect to instance
- click on instance id
- on the top left corner, click on connect option
- use ec2 instance connect and click on connect
Four ways
1. Ec2 instance connect
	use this if you are good with commands

- IP is the private ip, the one on the command shell

- download mobaxterm 
	toolbox for remote computing
- since the view that we get from ec2 is cli, and it is difficult to use

- open mobaxterm
- click on session in mobaxterm
- click on SSH - used to connect virtual machines
- remote host details - go back to instance - instance id - either you public ip address or public ip dns - paste in remote host
- specify username - add the user name used to connect the Ec2 instance
- port 22 is the default port
- advanced ssh settings - use private key - upload the key where you downloaded it - accept it
- we get the same view as the one from EC2

private Ip - internal ip for that network
public ip - external for the internet

- for next time on mobaXterm

- mkdir test
- it will get created in the home/ec2-user
- right click on the folder and download the folder
- don't delete stuff from the linux os
- upload - drag and drop

SSH Client
- multiple ways to connect ssh server
- its a package on windows
- type ssh in powershell
- locate private key and give it proper access

- click on instance and check on different instance state available
- instance cost is stopped when you stop the instance but the SSD used while making instance is still in use and therefore we also nneed to close it

- start instance
- terminate instance means deleting instance - this deletes the instannce

volumes 

how to keep your public ip to be same
- elastic ip keeps your ip same 
- as the ip 

AMI 
amazon machine images

lamp server
linux, apache, mysql, perl

ami for application 
benefit is that the application get installed at the time of instance creation

t2 micro
1 gb r
8gb storage 
1 cpu

ssh work on port 22

root volume - when instance gets deleted root volume gets deleted
ebs volume do not get deleted 

volume can be created and then attached to an instance
one instance can have multiple volume
it is not advisable to share volume between instances

iops - input output operation per sec
100 iops

snapshot
- is created for a volume
- it copies the volume at a point
- it is like a backup of the volume
- we can create volume from snapshot

autoscaling group
- you setup the min size
- desired capacity
- maximum size
size means number of instancesd

Ec2 - elastic compute cloud - infrastructure as a aservice
features -
renting virtual machines (EC2)
storing data on virtual drive (ebs)
distributing load across machines (elb)
scaling the services using an auto scaling group (asg)

to run a website on EC2, we will have to install a webserver
on the ec2 

user always connect to the load balancer ip

sage maker in aws used for ml

security group
- control how traffic is allowed into or out of the system

- port 22 SSH
- port 445 https
- port 80 http

445 and 80 are used for webservers access

on demand instances - short workload, predictable pricing
reserved: min 1 year max 3 years
spot instances : short workloads, cheap, can lose instances
dedicated hosts : book an entire physical server, control instance place
dedicated instances : no other customers will share your hardware

spot instances

dedicated host - book an entire physical server, control instance

dedicated instances - no other customers will share you hardware

instances are subset of host

vertical scalability


How to connect to mobaxterm
- click on session on top left
- click on SSH on top left
- put public ip address of instance in the remote host
- put ec2-user in specify username
- port 22
- advanced ssh setting - put the key file for the instance
congratulations you are connected to your ec2 instance
